While the attribute system in Minecraft is quite versatile, Mojang has imposed artificial limits on many of the
attribute properties. These limits often go unnoticed but can unintentionally constrain many mods. The AttributeFix mod
addresses this issue by substantially increasing these limits to a more practical range.
