Open Loader is a utility mod that makes it easier to load data packs and resource packs automatically across all saves
for a given game instance. This mod can be used by mod packs and servers to define custom recipes and other features for
a wide range of mods. It can also be used to change textures, override tooltips, and change other aspects of the game.

## Data Packs
Data packs are a vanilla Minecraft feature that allows you to add and modify game data. Data packs are used for recipes,
loot tables, world gen, and many other game mechanics. Many mods also use data from data packs for their custom recipe
types and other mechanics. Normally data packs are installed per-world and are not enabled by default making them
difficult to use in mod packs. Open Loader solves this issue by allowing the game to load data packs from a specified
folder on all worlds.

### Data Folder
Open Loader will load data packs from the `/config/openloader/data` folder. This folder will be generated for you the
first time you run the game **after** installing the mod. Open Loader can load `.zip` archive packs and folder packs. An
example data pack can be downloaded [here](https://docs.darkhax.net/assets/open-loader/datapack-1.0.0.zip).

<FileTree>
    - .minecraft
      - config
        - openloader
          - **data**
            - my-archive-pack.zip
            - my-folder-pack
              - data/
              - pack.png
              - pack.mcmeta
          - resources/
      - logs/
      - mods/
      - resourcepacks/
      - saves/
</FileTree>

## Resource Packs
Resource packs are a vanilla Minecraft feature that allows you to add and modify game resources. Resource packs are used
for textures, sounds, models, fonts, and other game mechanics. Many mods also use resource packs for modded resources
like skins and overlays. Normally resource packs are installed from the `resourcepacks` folder but Minecraft will not
load them by default. Open Loader solves this issue by forcefully enabling resource packs that are loaded from its own
folder.

### Resources Folder
Open Loader will load resource packs from the `/config/openloader/resources` folder. This folder will be generated for
you the first time you run the game **after** installing the mod. Open Loader can load `.zip` archive packs and folder
packs. An example resource pack can be downloaded [here](https://docs.darkhax.net/assets/open-loader/resourcepack-1.0.0.zip).

<FileTree>
    - .minecraft
      - config
        - openloader
          - data/
          - **resources**
            - my-archive-pack.zip
            - my-folder-pack
              - data/
              - pack.png
              - pack.mcmeta
      - logs/
      - mods/
      - resourcepacks/
      - saves/
</FileTree>

## Configuration
Open Loader should work fine out of the box, however there are several config options that can be useful in special
situations. Open Loader reads config options from the `config/openloader/advanced_options.json` file.

:::note[Config File Generation]
The config file will be generated in the **config** folder the first time you start the game **after** installing the
mod. This is the standard way to generate a config file with default options. The config file is **NOT** inside the JAR
file that you downloaded.
:::

<FileTree>
    - .minecraft
      - config
        - openloader
          - **advanced_options.json**
      - logs/
      - mods/
      - resourcepacks/
      - saves/
</FileTree>

:::caution[Config Reloading]
This config file can not be reloaded while the game is open. For changes to take effect you must close the game and
launch it again. The `/reload` command and the `F3+T` keybind will not reload the file.
:::

### Options
The `advanced_options.json` file is a simple text file that can be edited using any text editor like notepad, nano, or
textedit. Inside the file you will find the following options.

```json
{
  "resourcePacks": {
    "enabled": true,
    "additionalFolders": []
  },
  "dataPacks": {
    "enabled": true,
    "additionalFolders": []
  }
}
```

By default Open Loader will try to load data packs and resource packs. You can prevent Open Loader from loading a type
of pack by setting the `enabled` option to `false`.

The `additionalFolders` option allows you to define new folders for Open Loader to search. These folders will be
searched in addition to the built-in `data` and `resources` folder. By default paths will be relative to the game
directory. A non-relative path can be defined by including the full path name, including the drive letter.

#### Relative Example
If you add `"custom_packs"` to the `additionalFolders` section Open Loader will try to load packs from the
`custom_packs` folder inside of your game instance folder. Relative paths can be especially useful when you can't
control where the pack is. For example CurseForge mod packs download data packs to the `resourcepacks` folder and this
can not be changed. You can still load these packs by adding `"resourcepacks"` to the `additionalFolders` option.

```json {4, 8}
{
  "resourcePacks": {
    "enabled": true,
    "additionalFolders": ["custom_packs"]
  },
  "dataPacks": {
    "enabled": true,
    "additionalFolders": ["resourcepacks"]
  }
}
```

<FileTree>
    - .minecraft
      - config/
      - **custom_packs/**
        - your_pack.zip
      - logs/
      - mods/
      - **resourcepacks/**
        - curseforge_pack.zip
      - saves/
</FileTree>

#### Absolute Path Examples
If you want to load packs from a specific location on your computer you can use an absolute path. For example you may
want to store all your data packs in your Windows `Documents` folder and load them in several different Minecraft
profiles. This can be done by adding the full path to `additionalFolders`. For example
`"C:\Users\My Windows Account\Documents\My Packs"` will load packs from the `My Packs` folder in your Windows documents.

```json
{
  "resourcePacks": {
    "enabled": true,
    "additionalFolders": ["C:/Users/My Windows Account/Documents/My Packs"]
  },
  "dataPacks": {
    "enabled": true,
    "additionalFolders": []
  }
}
```

## FaQ

### Does this support mods like Patchouli or Botany Pots?
Yes, packs loaded by this mod will behave exactly like packs loaded through the vanilla system. Anything that works with
the vanilla pack folders should also work with Open Loader folders.

### My pack isn't loading?
If your pack is not loading it is because you have placed the pack in the wrong folder or your pack is invalid. Please
download the example [data pack](https://docs.darkhax.net/assets/open-loader/datapack-1.0.0.zip) or
[resource pack](https://docs.darkhax.net/assets/open-loader/resourcepack-1.0.0.zip) and try to load it. If the pack is
not loaded you are using the wrong folder. If it does load, the pack you made was invalid. Make sure you have included a
`pack.mcmeta` file and check the log file for any errors related to your pack.

### How does load order work?
When a new pack is loaded by Open Loader it will be loaded after vanilla and modded packs. Once a pack has been loaded
Minecraft will lock the load order for future runs in order to maintain the stability of your world. This means that any
new mods or packs installed at a later date will load on top of your Open Loader packs. To avoid this issue I recommend
changing the name of your packs every time you update your mod pack.

### I don't get the resources when I join the server?
Open Loader and the packs you want to load must be installed on the client. Open Loader will not sync data to the client
for you. This is not what the mod is intended for. The vanilla game already has a system to prompt players to download a
resource pack when they join your server, you should use that instead.
