When Bookshelf is installed it will generate and load several language entries. These entries map to specific game
properties and provide a way to display these properties without knowing their value. These properties are generated on
the client and are never sent to the server or other players. Players can only see their own properties.

## Using Extended Text
Extended text entries are referenced using a localization key. The format used for the localization key is
`text.bookshelf.ext.prop_name` where `prop_name` is the name of the property you want. For example the `mc_version`
property would be `text.bookshelf.ext.mc_version`.

:::tip[Localization Keys]
Localization keys can be used by virtually anything that allows custom text in Minecraft. This includes books, signs,
commands, and most mod features that display text. Bookshelf uses localization keys instead of a custom text type in
order to maintain compatibility with the vanilla network protocol and other mods. Players without the Bookshelf mod will
see the translation key or the fallback text if a fallback is specified.

## Available Properties
The following properties are available when Bookshelf is installed.

## Examples
The following examples show how extended entries from Bookshelf can be used.

### TellRaw Example
The tellraw command allows you to send formatted text in chat. This example will post a chat message that displays the
readers own Minecraft version.

```console
/tellraw @p {"translate": "text.bookshelf.ext.mc_version"}
```

### Sign Example
The following command will give you a sign item that will display the readers Minecraft version once placed. This is
done by setting the NBT data of the sign.
```console
/give @a oak_sign{BlockEntityTag:{front_text:{messages:['["Your Minecraft"]','["version is"]','[{"translate":"text.bookshelf.ext.mc_version"}]','[""]']}}}
```

### Book Example
The following command will give you a sign item that will display the readers Minecraft version.

```console
/give @p written_book{pages:['{"translate": "text.bookshelf.ext.mc_version"}'],title:"Your Minecraft Version",author:Darkhax}
```

### JSON Example
Data packs and resource packs often use JSON files to add and configure properties. The following example shows the
property as a JSON object. This format is very similar to the format used in commands and NBT.

```json
{
  "translate": "text.bookshelf.ext.prop_name"
}
```

### Fallback Example
Translation text components can specify a fallback value if the translation key is not present. This can be useful for
changing the text if the reader does not have Bookshelf or another mod installed. The following example will print the
readers version of `examplemod` or the word `None`.

```console
/tellraw @p ["","Your version of ExampleMod is: ",{"translate":"text.bookshelf.ext.examplemod_version","color":"green", "fallback":"None"}]
```
