Bookshelf is a library mod that aims to improve the experience of creating and maintaining Minecraft content. Bookshelf 
contains a collection of code, frameworks, utilities, and other resources that I have put together over the years. The 
Bookshelf library is trusted by millions of players and is used by over 42,000 projects!

## Why use a library mod?
Library mods like Bookshelf offer many benefits to players and mod developers. The biggest benefit is that they allow 
seemingly unrelated mods to share some of the same code. This reduces the amount of time required to create and maintain
certain mods or features. Library mods are also tested in a wide range of circumstances and communities which can lead 
to less bugs and better performance.
