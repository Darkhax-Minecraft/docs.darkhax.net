Bookshelf is a library mod that aims to improve the experience of creating and maintaining Minecraft content. Bookshelf 
contains a collection of code, frameworks, utilities, and other resources that I have put assembled over the years. Many
mods such as [Dark Utilities](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dark-utilities) and 
[Botany Pots](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/botany-pots) rely on Bookshelf to power their mods! Bookshelf
is trusted by millions of players and is used by over 42,000 projects!

## Why use a library mod?
Library mods like Bookshelf offer many benefits to both players and mod developers. The biggest benefit is that they 
allow seemingly unrelated mods to share the same code. This reduces the amount of time required to develop and maintain
certain mods and features. Library mods are also tested in a wider range of circumstances and communities which can lead
to less bugs and better performance for players.
