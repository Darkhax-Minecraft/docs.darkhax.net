Enchantment Descriptions aims to clarify enchantments by adding descriptions of their effects to enchanted items. Most
modded enchantments are also supported!

## Localization
Enchantment Descriptions is available in over 15 languages including Spanish, Chinese, Russian, and French! If you are
fluent in another language and would like to help translate the mod to even more languages please check out our language
file on [GitHub](https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Enchantment-Descriptions/blob/1.20.1/common/src/main/resources/assets/enchdesc/lang/en_us.json).

## Configuration
Enchantment descriptions will use the `enchdesc.json` file for configuration options. Like most mods, the config file
can be found in your games config folder.

:::note[Config File Generation]
The config file will be generated in the **config** folder the first time you start the game **after** installing the
mod. This is the standard way to generate a config file with default options. The config file is **NOT** inside the JAR
file that you downloaded.
:::

<FileTree>
    - .minecraft
      - config
        - **enchdesc.json**
      - logs/
      - mods/
      - resourcepacks/
      - saves/
</FileTree>

:::caution[Config Reloading]
This config file can not be reloaded while the game is open. For changes to take effect you must close the game and
launch it again. The `/reload` command and the `F3+T` keybind will not reload the file.

### Options
The `enchdesc.json` file is a simple text file that can be edited using notepad, nano, textedit, or any other text
editor program. Inside the file you will see the following options.

| Property                     | Default                 | Functionality                                                                                            |
|------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| enableMod                    | true                    | Determines if the mod and its features are enabled or not.                                               |
| onlyDisplayOnBooks           | false                   | When enabled, descriptions will only display on enchanted books.                                         |
| onlyDisplayInEnchantingTable | false                   | When enabled, descriptions will only display inside the enchanting table GUI.                            |
| requireKeybindPress          | false                   | When enabled, you must hold the crouch keybind down to see descriptions.                                 |
| indentSize                   | 0                       | The amount of spaces to indent descriptions by.                                                          |
| style                        | \{"color":"dark_gray"\} | Sets the visual style of the description in game. Learn more about styles [here](/minecraft/text/style). |

## Adding/Modifying Descriptions
This mod uses Minecraft's built in language system to find descriptions. This allows mods and resource packs to easily
add or modify descriptions without any code. Descriptions use a translation key that is based on the ID of the
enchantment. The format is similar to the key used by Minecraft to define the enchantments name.

The format is `enchantment.{namespace}.{path}.desc`. For example the `minecraft:sharpness` enchantment would use the
localization key of `enchantment.minecraft.sharpness.desc`. You can find an example resource pack that does this
[here](https://docs.darkhax.net/assets/enchantment_descriptions/Enchantment-Descriptions-Examples-1.0.0.zip). If you are
a mod developer adding support in your own mod, you should use your mods pre-existing resource pack.

:::tip[Modifying Descriptions]
When replacing an existing description it is important to use the same namespace as the language file that is adding it.
For example if you want to replace a built-in description you should use the assets/enchdesc/lang folder. This will
reduce weird issues caused by the load order of the game.
