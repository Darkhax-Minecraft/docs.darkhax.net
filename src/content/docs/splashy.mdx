The splashy mod provides tools for customizing the splash text on the main menu of the game. For example, you can add
new splash text entries and remove the built-in vanilla ones!

## Configuration
Splashy will use the `splashy.json` file for configuration options. Like most mods, the config file can be found in your
games config folder.

:::note[Config File Generation]
The config file will be generated in the **config** folder the first time you start the game **after** installing the
mod. This is the standard way to generate a config file with default options. The config file is **NOT** inside the JAR
file that you downloaded.
:::

<FileTree>
    - .minecraft
      - config
        - **splashy.json**
      - logs/
      - mods/
      - resourcepacks/
      - saves/
</FileTree>

:::caution[Config Reloading]
This config file can not be reloaded while the game is open. For changes to take effect you must close the game and
launch it again. The `/reload` command and the `F3+T` keybind will not reload the file.

### Options

The `splashy.json` file is a simple text file that can be edited using notepad, nano, textedit, or any other text editor
program. Inside the file you will see the following options.

| Property               | Default | Functionality                                                                         |
|------------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| includeVanillaSplashes | true    | When disabled, only splashes defined using the Splashy mod will be displayed.         |
| includeModNames        | true    | When enabled the names of all installed mods will be added as potential splash texts. |
| customSplashes         | []      | An array of splash text entries to add to the pool of possible splash text entries.   |
| displaySplashes        | true    | When disabled, splash texts will not be rendered at all.                              |'

### Splash Text Entries

New splash texts can be added to the `customSplashes` property. Each string in this array represents a new entry that
may show up in game. The entry can be a simple string with the text of your splash text.

```json {4-8} title="config/splashy.json"
{
  "includeVanillaSplashes": true,
  "includeModNames": true,
  "customSplashes": [
    "Hello World",
    "Read the docs!",
    "Yet Another Splash Text"
  ],
  "displaySplashes": true
}
```

### Localized Text Entries
If the splash entry matches a valid localization key the mod will attempt to localize it using the players selected
language. For example adding `item.minecraft.stone_axe` will display the name of the stone axe item in the players
current language. We recommend using localized splash entries whenever possible. New localization keys can be defined
using a vanilla language file.

```json {4-6} title="config/splashy.json"
{
  "includeVanillaSplashes": true,
  "includeModNames": true,
  "customSplashes": [
    "your_pack.splashes.hello_world"
  ],
  "displaySplashes": true
}
```

```json title="assets/your_pack/lang/en_us.json"
{
  "your_pack.splashes.hello_world": "Hello World!"
}
```

```json title="assets/your_pack/lang/es_mx.json"
{
  "your_pack.splashes.hello_world": "Hola Mundo!"
}
```
