Minecraft does not keep a registry of screens. This makes referencing them in user configs especially challenging
because they do not have IDs to reference. Historically mods have used the internal class name as a pseudo-id which is
confusing and not consistent between mod loaders. To make things easier the Tips mod creates IDs for all of the vanilla
screens that you can use to reference the screen.

:::caution[Modded Screens]
We have only given IDs to vanilla screens. If a screen is added by a mod or mod loader it will not have an ID. Vanilla
screens that have been replaced by another mod will also not have an ID. You can still reference these screens using
their internal class names.

## Screen IDs

:::danger[Unofficial IDs]
The following list of IDs are only valid with the Tips mod. These IDs have not been assigned by Mojang and will not work
with other Minecraft mods.
