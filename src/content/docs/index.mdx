This is the official documentation for Minecraft mods developed by **Darkhax**. This section of the site is specifically
for Minecraft **{gameVersion}**! If you are using a different version of the game you should swap to a different version
of this page!

## FaQ

### How do I use this website?
Every mod has its own section in the sidebar where you can find documentation for players and technical info for
servers, modpacks, and other mod developers. On most screens the sidebar will be on the left side of the screen. Devices
with smaller screens can access the sidebar by clicking the menu icon in the top right.

### The mod I am looking for is not here!
This could be for one of the following reasons:
- The mod has not been updated to the version of Minecraft you are looking at. This section of the site only has mods
  from Minecraft {gameVersion}. Mods for newer or older versions of Minecraft will not be displayed here unless they are
  compatible with this version.
- Only mods developed by [Darkhax](https://www.curseforge.com/members/darkhaxdev/projects) are documented here. If he is
  not a developer of the mod, or is only a contributor, the mod will not be documented here.
- We may not have gotten around to it yet. While we aim to provide extensive and complete documentation it is important
  to remember that these mods are provided for free and this website is operated by volunteers.

### Can I help translate this site?
Thank you for your interest in translating this documentation. Our current focus is on making sure the mods have been
adequately documented in english. Our site code does have the ability to offer localized versions of a page though, and
it is something we would like to work with the community on in the future.
