Welcome to the official documentation for Darkhax's Minecraft **{gameVersion}** mods! If you are using a different
version of Minecraft you should change your version [here](https://docs.darkhax.net). Every mod has its own section in
the sidebar where you can find detailed guides and technical info to help you better understand and utilize the mod. On
most devices the sidebar will be on the left side of your screen. Devices with smaller screens can find the sidebar by
clicking the menu icon in the top right.

## Can't find a mod?
This could be for one of the following reasons:
- The mod has not been updated to this version of Minecraft yet. This section of the site only has mods that support
  Minecraft {gameVersion}.
- Only mods developed by [Darkhax](https://mods.darkhax.net) are documented here. If he is not a developer of the mod,
  or is only a contributor, the mod likely won't be listed here.
- We may not have gotten to it yet. While we aim to provide extensive and complete documentation it is important to
  remember that these mods are provided for free and this website is operated by volunteers.
