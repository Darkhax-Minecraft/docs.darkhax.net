description: A guide to the custom markdown syntax that is available.

This website has several custom markdown features that can be used to enhance project documentation. This page attempts
to document most of these features.

## CurseForge Project Embed

::cf-embed[]{p=862201}
::cf-embed[]{p=228525}
::cf-embed[]{p=353928}

## CurseForge Project Banner

We have a custom markdown plugin that will embed a banner for a project on CurseForge. This should be used at the top of
any page that documents a specific project. This will hopefully help prevent readers confusing what mod the
documentation is for.

### All Banner Options
| Property       | Example   | Default | Functionality                                                   |
|----------------|-----------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| p or projectId | p=2228525 | NONE    | Sets the ID of the CurseForge project to generate a banner for. |

### Examples
```md
::cf-banner[]{p=228525}
::cf-banner[]{p=353928}
::cf-banner[]{p=242195}
````

::cf-banner[]{p=228525}
::cf-banner[]{p=353928}
::cf-banner[]{p=242195}

## YouTube Embeds

We have a custom markdown plugin that allows us to embed videos. There are a lot of options but they generally should
not be needed or used.

- `::youtube[]{v=fGUdgi5TW0E}` - Simple 16:9 video embed.
- `::youtube[]{v=fGUdgi5TW0E start=5}` - Starts the video at 5 seconds.
- `::youtube[]{v=fGUdgi5TW0E vertical=1}` - Shows a vertical 9:16 video, like a short.

### All YouTube Embed Options

### YouTube Embed CSS Classes
The embedded iframe will always be wrapped in a div with the `yt-embed-container` class. It will also have `yt-embed-h`
or `yt-embed-v` if `vertical=1` was set. The embedded iframe will have the `yt-embed-video` class.

Starlight sets the height of iframe to auto which doesn't work well with youtube videos. This is fixed by forcing the
height to 100%.
```css
.yt-embed-video {
    height: 100% !important;
}
```

To control the aspect ratio we're using the tailwind aspect ratio plugin.
```css
.yt-embed-h {
    @apply aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9;
}

.yt-embed-v {
    @apply aspect-w-9 aspect-h-16;
}
```

### Examples

#### Horizontal
::youtube[]{v=fGUdgi5TW0E}

#### Vertical
::youtube[]{v=fGUdgi5TW0E vertical=true}
