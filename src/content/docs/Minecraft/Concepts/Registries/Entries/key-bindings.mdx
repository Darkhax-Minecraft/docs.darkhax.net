title: Key Bindings
description: A list of key bindings in Minecraft 1.20.1
---
Key bindings provide a way for the player to interact with and control the game.

## Configurable Key Bindings
This table contains a list of key bindings that the player can configure in the options menu.

:::caution[Missing Keys]
Key bindings that can not be configured are excluded from this list. These keys are often hard coded into the game and
do not have key IDs or names. If a key binding does not have a key or a name it can not be referenced.
