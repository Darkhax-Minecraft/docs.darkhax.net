Minecraft uses resource locations to identify and organize game objects. They are sometimes called namespaced
identifiers or just identifiers. If you have seen an ID like `minecraft:dirt` you have already seen a resource location.

## Structure
Resource locations have two parts that are separated using a colon `:`. The first half is called the **namespace**. The
namespace is the source of the resource. The second half is the path, which is the resource itself. Here are a few
examples breaking down resource locations.

- `minecraft:dirt` - An entry called `dirt` that is added by `minecraft`.
- `create:zinc_ingot` - An entry called `zinc_ingot` that is added by `create`.
- `tipsmod:smoke_bees` - An entry called `smoke_bees` that is added by `tipsmod`.

:::tip[Choosing a Namespace]
When you are adding a new resource you should always use your own namespace instead of the `minecraft` namespace or the
namespace of another mod. This will avoid confusion and potential ID conflicts. If you want to replace or expand a
resource you should use the same namespace and path as the target resource.
:::

## Valid Characters
Resource locations can only contain the following characters. Using an invalid character in your resource location will
prevent your resource from loading or being used.

- Lowercase latin alphabet - `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`
- Numbers - `0123456789`
- Underscore - `_`
- Hyphen - `-`
- Period - `.`

The path may also use a forward slash (`/`). The forward slash is **not** valid for namespaces.

:::caution[Invalid Characters]
Using invalid characters is the most common issue people experience with resource locations. You can **NOT** use spaces,
upper case letters, or non-latin letters. These are strict limitations imposed by Minecraft.

## File Paths
Resource locations can also be used to reference a file in a data pack or resource pack. The namespace and path are
combined with a resource type to create the file path. This process also works in reverse, using the location and name
of a file to create a resource location. Additionally, data files are held in a `data` folder while client side
resources like textures and models are held in an `assets` folder. To give an example, a recipe with the resource
location `example:dirt` is referencing the `data/example/recipes/dirt.json` file. If a file is located in sub-folders
forward slashes will be used. For example the texture `assets/example/textures/item/my_texture.png` is referenced using
the resource location `example:item/my_texture`.

:::caution[File Extensions]
In most cases file extensions like `.png` and `.json` are not included in the namespace. This is because the game
already knows the type of file it is looking and will add it automatically. If an extension is required it should be
mentioned in the documentation.
