Darkhax is a software developer from Canada who has been creating free Minecraft mods for over 14 years. This site aims
to provide comprehensive documentation and guides for all of Darkhax's mods, helping you get the most out of your modded
Minecraft experience!

## Our Mods
Darkhax develops a broad range of mods that cater to different aspects of Minecraft gameplay. Whether you're looking to
enhance the survival experience, add new mechanics, or customise the game completely, we have something for everyone.
Each mod is crafted with care, ensuring high quality and compatibility with other mods.

## Downloading Mods
These mods are only available on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/members/darkhaxdev/projects) and
[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/Darkhax). Other websites offering downloads for these mods are not authorized and
are best avoided. Other sites often contain misleading information or even malware! These malicious websites will often
claim to have newer versions or better features, they are trying to trick you. If you are desperate for a newer version,
please be patient and wait for an official release.
